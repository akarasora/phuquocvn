            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> There is a small island that is separate from Vietnam. It is known as Phu Quoc, and it is one of the most popular beach islands in Vietnam, beside Ha Long Bay. Despite the fact that native Vietnamese describe it as a small island, Phu Quoc is Vietnam's largest island. Many say it is "Pearl Island" due to its breathtaking views of the sea, mountains, and forest. Tourists can also discover a variety of exciting areas, such as a nature park, Hon Mot Island, Vin Wonders, and so on. Along with traditional village activities, diving into the sea, and sky trams.

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p> Phu Quoc is located quietly away from southwest Vietnam and is part of Kien Giang province. On this beautiful island, visitors get to observe the majestic giant mountains together with the green forests. Even though the island is surrounded by sea, the water level around the island is quite shallow, less than 10 meters deep, so visitors will not be worried about the depth of the sea. While the climate is divided into dry and rainy seasons, it does not affect much of the local life because the temperature is quite warm. The beach stretches from north to south, and at the southern end lies a vibrant village where tourists are going to get an opportunity to discover during their visit. At the same time, this tropical island has a lot of stunning waterfalls and beautiful scenery, where you can observe the unique creatures and go hiking.

            <h2>People</h2>
            <p> Hospitable, chastity, and amiable are words that are used to describe the people in Phu Quoc. Fishermen and other residents sometimes serve as guides for tourists. Normally, Vietnamese on the mainland do not speak English frequently; however, this is not the case in Phu Quoc. Since tourists are everywhere, most locals do know how to communicate in English. For example, people can find a fisherman or a farmer having conversations with foreigners. Despite the fact that many individuals from other provinces come to work and live on Phu Quoc Island, the locals here are extremely grateful for the contribution of the Chinese-Vietnamese community. They have helped by developing several wonderful and traditional foods for Phu Quoc services.</p>

          <h2>Economy</h2>
          <p> An ideal location for investors. Aside from forests, other resources such as land, sea, and freshwater offer great potential for economic development. Phu Quoc is well-known for its green peppers and fish sauce; these two businesses have always been highly successful. Furthermore, tourism activities have grown significantly, allowing residents to deliver a wide range of services. With over hundreds of lodgings and hotels, as well as having such wonder activities, Phu Quoc has welcomed millions of tourists throughout the year. This destination is always the best idea for a vacation. During COVID-19, Phu Quoc struggled because visitor revenue had dropped. On the other hand, real estate investors performed better as it continued to rise during the pandemic.
